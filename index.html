    <h2>Here's how states and universities benefit from the student debt crisis</h2>

    In September, six states filed a <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/biden-v-nebraska-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> against the Biden administration to effectively stall Biden’s August 2022 plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt for individual borrowers. Now, ahead of next month’s Supreme Court decision and the end of the COVID-19 pandemic moratorium on student loans, finances are in limbo for millions of borrowers.

<p>The case, <em>Biden v. Nebraska</em> — brought jointly by Nebraska, Arkansas, Missouri, South Carolina, Iowa and Kansas — calls into question the Biden administration’s authority to enact the plan under the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/556.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Administrative Procedure Act</a>. But data show that those six plaintiff states rely more on loan revenue compared to national averages, while still constituting populations that are disproportionately harmed by student loan debt.</p> 

<p>With the Supreme Court case pending and a new class of college graduates entering the workforce, NCC News broke down how states and universities stand to benefit — and why some borrowers are at greater detriment — from resumed loan payments even after the moratorium ends this summer. </p> 

<p>Colleges and universities in the U.S. are, as categorized by the U.S. Department of Education, public and largely state-funded; private and non-profit; or public and for-profit. Depending on how this control is distributed within states, and among universities, parties who stand to benefit from student loan debt can vary significantly, said Perry Singleton, an economist and a professor at SU with expertise in politics and finance.</p> 

<p>“As for the smoking gun in these six states filing the lawsuit, it's because there's a big portion of the economy that is dependent on servicing these loans and making money from them,” Singleton said. </p> 

<p>In states with greater proportions of public compared to private institutions, he said, state governments’ economic systems rely more on loan revenue than do states where higher education is more privatized. Of the 526 colleges and universities in the six plaintiff states for which the USDOE’s <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">College Scorecard</a> provides data, the proportion of public schools to private (both for- and non-profit) is 11.25% higher than the national average. </p> 

<p>The six suing states also rely disproportionately on loans rather than grants compared to the national average, 2021-22 Title IV <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/title-iv" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the USDOE’s Federal Student Aid Office show. Excluding the six suing states, loan allocations were on average around 120% of the number of grant allocations. On average among those six states, though, loan allocations were around 235% of the number of grant allocations. </p> 

<p>Much of the difference between states’ approaches falls along party lines despite greater need because of ideological rifts in approaches to higher education, Singleton said. To SU professor Sean Drake, who specializes in race and ethnicity and education, it’s essential to look at which students are most harmed by loan debt — and consequently would benefit most from the forgiveness plan — at this level. </p> 

<p>When he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> the plan last August, President Joe Biden stated equity as a main objective for loan forgiveness. Singleton said that in line with that goal, the plan employs Pell Grants as a way to target generational wealth gaps in addressing student debt.</p> 

<p>Pell Grants, which are need-based in their <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell" rel="noopener" target="_blank">calculation and distribution</a>, go to the students who are most in need of education financing based on the estimated money their family is projected to contribute. An analysis of data for Pell Grant recipients by state shows that Republican-led states, including the six plaintiff states in Biden v. Nebraska, have on average more recipients than do Democrat-led states. </p> 

<p>“There's a wave of anti-intellectualism that's kind of pervasive in the US overall,” Singleton said. “Some states that have an electoral base who simply see (loan forgiveness) as subsidizing this ivory tower and they want nothing of it.”</p> 

<p>As far as the grants themselves, Singleton said, the plan uses Pell Grants as a tool to target and benefit students with generational disadvantage by incorporating past-Pell Grant receipt. Even after graduation, analysis of Scorecard data shows that former students who received Pell Grants pay off loans at a rate 20 percentage points lower than non-recipients over a three-year period. </p> 

<p>“It’s saying, ‘Oh, you may be a doctor now. You may be a lawyer making six figures now. But if you had a Pell Grant, we knew that you really did pull yourself up by the bootstraps,’” Singleton said. “That person really doesn’t have the intergenerational wealth advantages that someone who is also a doctor or lawyer who didn't need a Pell Grant.”</p> 

<p>States in the Northeast region — nearly <a href="https://protectborrowers.org/historic-coalition-of-cities-states-experts-and-advocates-defend-action-to-cancel-student-debt-before-the-supreme-court/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all of which support</a> the forgiveness plan — receive less Pell Grants funding than states in the South and Southeast, according to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the Pew Research Center. Effectively, Singleton said, the loan forgiveness plan’s biggest detractors host the populations that need the relief the most.</p> 

<p>Singleton also said that decreases in state funding have pushed universities to fill fiscal holes by putting the burden solely on the individual student and family. Drake, who wrote the book “Academic Apartheid: Race and the Criminalization of Failure in an American Suburb,” pointed to the racial wealth gap as a risk factor in student loan practices which hurt low-income students and families. </p> 

<p>“The amount of debt that students have leaving college, leaving graduate school, really contributes to socioeconomic inequalities,” Drake said. “If you are from a lower-income background, then it's harder to pay that debt down, and you're gonna have more debt to begin with. So it's kind of a compounding kind of a compounding issue.”</p> 

<p>At private, for-profit colleges and universities, Singleton said that “egregious” enrollment practices cause people to take out more loans than are reasonable for their finances or career path. According to the same Scorecard data from the USDOE, low-income borrowers who attended a for-profit private university repay student loans at a rate 17.5% lower than low-income borrowers who attended a non-profit private university.</p>

<p>Drake emphasized the disproportionate impact of student loans and debt on those people with lower-income backgrounds and on people of color, saying that it’s important to ask questions about the full picture and scrutinize perceptions that people who have smaller or no loans worked harder or managed their finances better when they were teenagers. He said that rather, overall, outcomes are largely a reflection of circumstances that aren’t a student or borrower’s fault. </p> 

<p>Singleton also said questioning systems is integral to pursuing equity and looking critically at student debt’s impact. He emphasized the importance of rooting out the key players, specifically those who are affected and stand to lose the most.</p> 

<p>“At the end of the day, it’s ‘Where's the money coming from? Where's it going?’” Singleton said. “‘Who's benefiting from it ultimately, and who's really at the end of the day hurting from this?’”</p>
