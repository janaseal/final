    <h2>Here's how loans and grants affect people paying off student loans and lending parties</h2>

    <p>In September, six states filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration to effectively stall Biden’s August 2022 plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt for borrowers. Now, ahead of next month’s Supreme Court decision and the end of the COVID-19 pandemic moratorium on student loans, finances are in limbo for millions of borrowers.</p>

    <p>The case, Biden v. Nebraska — brought jointly by Nebraska, Arkansas, Missouri, South Carolina, Iowa and Kansas — calls into question the Biden administration’s authority to enact the plan under the Administrative Procedure Act. But data show that those six plaintiff states rely more on loan revenue compared to national averages, while still constituting populations that are disproportionately harmed by student loan debt.</p>

    <p>With the Supreme Court case pending and a new class of college graduates entering the workforce, NCC News broke down how states and universities stand to benefit — and why some borrowers stand to lose the most — from resumed loan payments even after the moratorium ends this summer. </p>

    <p>Colleges and universities in the U.S. are either public and largely state-funded, private and non-profit or public and for-profit. Depending on the distribution of control and profit within states, and among universities, parties who stand to benefit from student loan debt can vary significantly, said Perry Singleton, an economist and a professor at SU with expertise in politics and finance.</p>

    <p>In states with greater proportions of public compared to private institutions, he said, state governments’ economic systems rely more on loan revenue than do states where higher education is more privatized. Of the 526 colleges and universities within the six plaintiff states for which the College Scorecard provides data, the proportion of public schools to private (both for- and non-profit) is 11.25% higher than the national average. </p>

    <p>Excluding the six suing states, loan allocations were on average around 120% of the number of grant allocations, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid Office. On average among those six states, though, loan allocations were around 235% of the number of grant allocations.</p> 

    <p>When he announced the plan last August, Biden stated equity as a main objective for loan forgiveness. Singleton said that in line with that goal, the plan employs Pell Grants as a way to target generational wealth gaps in addressing student debt.</p> 

    <p>Pell Grants, which are need-based in their calculation and distribution, go to the students who are most in need of education financing based on the estimated money their family is projected to contribute. An analysis of data for Pell Grant recipients by state shows that Republican-led states, including the six plaintiff states in Biden v. Nebraska, have on average more recipients than do Democrat-led states.</p>

   <p>Republican-led states have more Pell Grant recipients on average compared to Democrat-led states— and the six plaintiff states have on average 20% more recipients compared to the national average.  </p>

    <p>Singleton said that by targeting borrowers who received them in the past, the plan uses Pell Grants as a tool to identify and benefit students with generational disadvantages. Effectively, he said, the loan forgiveness plan’s biggest detractors host the populations that need the relief the most.</p>
